                        Mid-West Tech Fest 2024 presents a spectacular arena for innovative thinkers to ignite new ideas and
                        showcase their creative prowess. In the hallowed halls of academia where engineering concepts come
                        to life, we beckon you to step beyond the usual and immerse yourself in the captivating world of
                        practical experimentation.
                        <br/><br/>The Tech Fest will span a month, featuring a series of engaging pre-events followed by captivating mega events that showcase the talents and achievements of our students. Through workshops, competitions, and exhibitions, we aim to create an unparalleled experience that enriches the academic journey of our students and elevates the reputation of our university. To ensure minimal disruption to classes, the majority of our activities will be conducted online during the first three weeks. However, the final week of the month-long fest will be physically held, featuring full-scale mega events that promise an immersive experience for all participants.
